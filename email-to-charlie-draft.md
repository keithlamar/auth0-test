Hi Charlie!

Thanks for taking the time to describe your current situation! It’s great your company has decided to convert its core business functions to SaaS applications, you’re going to love the flexibility and ease of system management it provides. 

First off, you came to the right place -- Auth0 is fully capable of providing the SSO functionality you’re looking for! SumoLogic and ~~BambooHR~~ can both be setup as applications in your Auth0 dashboard, there’s some great documentation on how applications work in Auth0 here: https://auth0.com/docs/applications

>Secondly, your custom internal identifier “uid” can easily be mapped in the SAML2WebApp Addon, more details about that here: >https://auth0.com/docs/saml-configuration#customizing-saml-assertions-auth0-as-idp-

>Lastly, we connect with a wide range of different Enterprise Identity Providers including SAML. With your particular setup >you would be using Auth0 as a SAML Service Provider and Identity Provider, you can find a quick description and diagram of >what that looks like here: https://auth0.com/docs/saml-configuration#saml-service-provider-and-identity-provider

Don’t worry if it seems overwhelming, we offer great support to all subscribers and can walk you through any complications with the setup. :)

If you head over to Auth0.com, you can create a free full-featured developer account and pay only when you have everything working just right!

Thanks again for contacting us Charlie, if you have any other questions don’t hesitate to ask!

Cheers!

Keith
