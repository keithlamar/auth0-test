Hi Charlie!

Hope all is well with your on-going conversion to SaaS applications with SSO! I was working with a tool our team created and it made me think of your project. :-) 

It’s an Open Source Single-Sign-On Dashboard, which you can customize to create a seamless and convenient way for users to access all their applications without the need to remember multiple URLs or repeatedly enter their credentials. 

A few key features of the Auth0 SSO Dashboard include:

Landing page showing all apps that a user is allowed to access.
* Self-service user profile updates.
* Administrator interface for configuring roles, apps, and users.
* Completely customizable UI.

Here’s a link to the Auth0 SSO Dashboard: https://github.com/auth0/auth0-sso-dashboard

Hopefully this tool makes your job that much easier! Let me know if you have any questions, we’re here to help in every way possible!

Cheers!

Keith
